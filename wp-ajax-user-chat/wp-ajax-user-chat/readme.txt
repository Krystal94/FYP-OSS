First ever simplest user to user wordpress chat plugin based on ajax. Registered users can chat with each other from front-end.

== Description ==

First ever simplest user to user wordpress chat plugin based on ajax. Registered users can chat with each other from front-end. Just get users registered to your website make them login and after login they can chat with each other. This chat plugin will create a private chat session between two users. I have tested this plugin on all the latest major browsers and it is working fine.  

**Why use wp ajax user chat plugin?**

Do you have users registered with your website and do you want them to chat internally then this plugin works like a charm for you.

Have you ever thought of a plugin that will provide you a platform for your users to chat internally and provide them a great user experience then this plugin is just what you need.

You can contact me if there is anything with which I can help you!

**how to you use this plugin?**

    No settings required to run this plugin :)

The only thing you need is registered users who can chat with each other. Just get people registered with your website and this plugin does the rest. Users need to login to the site and then only they can chat with each other.

**there is lot more to come**

    I am working on making this plugin better and will keep it updated and will improve further. Currently this plugin is tested with the latest version of wordpress and it is working perfectly.

The chat which will be done between the users will not be available the next time. This means that once the chat box will be closed the chat session finishes. New chat session wont have the previous chat messages available next time. 

Share this plugin if you liked it.

Thanks :)
